# census_ml_matches

This is the repository of US historical census matches 1850 - 1940 corresponding to the paper "A New Algorithm to Efficiently Match U.S. Census Records and Balance Representativity with Match Quality" by Eric Protzer, Sultan Orazbayev, Andres Gomez-Lievano, Matte Hartog, and Frank Neffke.

We will publish matches here once relevent permissions are obtained.
